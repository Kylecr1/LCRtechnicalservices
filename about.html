    <h2>Pride</h2>
    <p>With the opening of our store in Tanki Leendert to celebrate its month in a story of effort and dedication. In August of this past year, amidst the uncertainty of the pandemic, we took a step toward building and inaugurating our Machine & Welding Shop in Sero Pita. With a vision and hard work, we have created our own path and are moving towards constructing our own building at San Barbola 2-A. We look back and see how our local organization has helped us. We are counting on our skills and Machine & Welding Shop in San Barbola and also a Welding Shop in Mahuma, the team to manage a large project. Previously there was only a dream, now it has become a reality. However, on this journey we have not done it alone. Every step has been possible thanks to the commitment of our team and continued support from our clients and partners. You are part of our success and our motivation to continue to grow.</p>
